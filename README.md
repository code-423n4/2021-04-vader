# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. (We'll set that one up later.) 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Contest prep

- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing
- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [ ] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [ ] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Add all of the code to this repo that you want reviewed
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 8 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [ ] Ensure that you have access to the _findings_ repo where issues will be submitted.
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

### Overview
VADER Protocol is an implemenation of the ideas discussed here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O10Pay1ZjBJwEjeHulp924-Cuustjatl7OoH-sGkDs8/edit?usp=sharing

### USDV
* Same concept as LUNA<>UST
https://terra.money/Terra_White_paper.pdf

### Liquidity
* Same concept as THORChain CLP 
https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/blob/master/Audits/THORChain-Gauntlet-CLPReport-Nov2020.pdf

### Synths
* Synthetic Assets minted from liquidity collateral using a formula that mints on the assymetric value of the deposited asset. 

### Lending
* Borrowing debt is faciliated by borrowing BASE collateral from the protocol, then paying it back, but price in Debt Value. Thus the protocol takes the short position on its own asset. 

### Non-standard ERC20
* VADER, USDV, SYNTHS all employ the `transferTo()` function, which interrogates for `tx.origin` and skips approvals. The author does not subscribe to the belief that this is dangerous, although users should be warned that they can be phished and stolen from *if they interact with attack contracts*. Since all these assets are intended to be used in the system itself, the risk of a user interacting with an attack contract is extremely low. 
* There are some discussion whether `tx.origin` will be deprecated, but the author believes that there is a really low chance it will, and if so, it will likely be replaced with `tx.orgin = msg.sender` which means the contracts will still work. Compatibility function have been added to anticipate this. 

### Unique
VADER is an implementation of various ideas across the space. There is nothing *new*, just a more cohesive system that takes advantage of several key concepts. 

### Known Issues (deviations from spec)
*will be updated if this list changes*
1) USDV staking is still present in the code, this will be removed for SYNTH-only staking in a separate Vault. 
2) Anchor pool creation is not curated
3) Interest Rate payment is not yet automatic
4) Interest Rate deductions not yet added
5) Liquidation logic not yet added
6) Purge Member logic not yet added
7) DEPLOYER privs not yet added
8) Full DAO functionality not yet added
9) Liquidity Limits not yet added
10) Various other small features

### Areas of Review

Ideally, the following is reviewed:
* Any attack vectors that can siphon funds from the system
* Any attack vectors using flash loans
* Any attack vectors by Anchor Price manipulation
* Any attack vectors by VADER<>USDV mint/burn
